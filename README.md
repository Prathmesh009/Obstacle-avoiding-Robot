# Obstacle-avoiding-Robot
A fully autonomous robot which can be able to avoid any obstacle which it face when it move.
Ultrasonic sensors were mounted on front neck of robot. From the obtained sensor output, NewPing
library was used to get the distance of an obstacle in front of robot and the movement is planned
accordingly. A microcontroller (ATmega328) is used to achieve the desired operation.
